% Second stage ini_file for YOUNG

% Revisions:
%
% Feb 10, 2025 (Rosie)
%	- Removed TS_1_1_1, TS_2_1_1, TS_3_1_1 per notes in first stage INI: sensors appear to be faulty from the beginning.
% Feb 2, 2025 (Rosie)
%	- Added NETRAD and ALB back to second stage (removed from first stage RAD include file) on principle, because they are 
% 	  "modelled" not measured.
% Jan 23, 2025 (Rosie)
%	- Moved all instances of "shiftMyData" function to first stage INI (verified independently that this works as desired).
%	  Removed shiftMyData for VPD_1_1_1, because this is calculated from TA and RH, which have already been shifted in first stage. 
%	  Removed shiftMyData for ET, because this is calculated from LE and TA, which have already been shifted in first stage. 
%	- Changed 'WS_1_1_1' to use 'WS' instead of 'wind_dir', as 'WS' is the default loaded in EddyPro_Common_FirstStage_include.
% Dec 16, 2024 (Rosie)
%	- Switched PA_ECCC and PA in calc_avg_trace function for PA_1_1_1, so the "baseline" is 
%	  ECCC slow-response pressure sensor (also has less missing data points), not IRGA pressure.
%	- shiftMyData time issue will be addressed before rerunning EddyPro in Jan 2025 (Sara/Rosie talked about this).
% Dec 12, 2024 (Rosie)
% 	- Moved "badWD" trace to first stage, and applied "tag_EC_fluxes" there,
%		now Evaluate feature is available in first stage. (This filter is now in third stage.)
% Nov 29, 2024 (Rosie)
%	- Removed NEE from second stage, per database meeting on 27 Nov 2024. 
%	- NEE is calculated in third stage.
% Nov 11, 2024 (Rosie)
%	- Cleaned up, removing obsolete parameters (minMax, originalVariable, etc.)
% May 21, 2024 (Zoran)
%   - Replaced:
%		badWD = find(WD_1_1_1 >= lower | WD_1_1_1 <= upper);
%     with:
%   	badWD = (WD_1_1_1 >= lower | WD_1_1_1 <= upper);
%	  to avoid having a trace badWD that is not of a full length. 
%     The original line would return < 17,520 points.
%
% Jan 29, 2024 (Ted)
%	- create WD filter trace "badWD" to use for cleaning out fluxes when wind is disturbed by tower before sonic
% Jan 18, 2024 (Ted)
%	- cleanup of lines using calc_avg_trace with single argument
% Jan 15, 2024 (Ted)
%	- add Evapotranspiration (ET) using LE and Latent_heat_vaporization biomet function
% Jan 11 2023 (Ted)
%	- we changed the calibration values for SWIN in 2021 to correct for a mismatch in the logger, which means we need to calculate
%	both RN_1_1_1 and ALB_1_1_1 here using the updated values for SWIN/OUT and LWIN/OUT
%	- RN_1_1_1 aka NETRAD_1_1_1 is SW_IN - SW_OUT + LW_IN - LW_OUT per Monteith & Unsworth 2013, p. 75
%	- as part of this update, I now replace negative values of SWOUT with NaN and for ALB anything outside 0-100 is set to NaN
% Mar 24, 2023 (Darian)
% 	- Added shiftMyData (adapted from Tzu-Yi Lu DSM site) to correct for daylight savings 60 min offset.
% 	- For future: Apply 60 min offset from siteStart to 2021 Nov 7 3:00:00 in EddyPro processing 
% 	  so raw files in database are also corrected.
